Why is it all of a sudden you want to push a transaction through but panicked and stopped
trying every time before?
Where did all of my crypto go? 
Why bring Terri to Vegas only to turn your back on her? 
Why do the same thing to me in California?
Why when you knew in Vegas did you let my name change documents, be switched and then deny that they where when I was so proud of having it done in the first place?
Why did you let jade and everyone at Dave’s steal and go through my property?
Why have someone put me in a hotel and just leave me there with nothing?
Why have everyone ignore me just to make me act crazy? 
This was all before I flipped on the one transaction! What about all the other transactions?
What happened to Tsunami Holdings, AG (https://www.linkedin.com/company/tsunami-holdings-ag/) or Vermil pandora? 
You just cast me to the side like everyone else because they didn’t fit your mold or because they let you assume like you knew what you where doing?
We had Bo and because you wouldn’t take advice or listen we didn’t finish the crypto. 
Or was this all part of your plan to f*ck everyone over?
Was It because you F*cked up by “Giving Me EVERTHING” You Assumed you can Claim my Identity And Split it with everyone if they turned there back PRAYING that 
Because you Stole my Documentation? I would ACTUALLY KILL MYSELF?
